# Winding Numbers for Zeta

The winding number provides topological protection for zeros.

## Main definitions

* `windingNumber`: W = (1/2πi) ∮ (ζ'/ζ) ds

## Main theorems

* `winding_is_integer`: W is always an integer
* `winding_counts_zeros`: W = (number of zeros) - (number of poles) inside contour
* `zeros_are_simple`: All non-trivial zeros have winding number 1

## Topological Protection

Since winding numbers are integers, zeros cannot "move continuously"
without changing W discretely. This provides topological protection.

/-! ## Winding Number Definition -/

/--
The winding number of ζ around a contour γ:
  W = (1/2πi) ∮_γ (ζ'/ζ) ds
-/
noncomputable def windingNumber (γ : ℝ → ℂ) (s₀ : ℂ) : ℤ :=
  sorry -- Requires proper contour integration setup

/-! ## Basic Properties -/

/-- Winding numbers are integers -/
theorem winding_is_integer (γ : ℝ → ℂ) (s₀ : ℂ) :
    ∃ n : ℤ, windingNumber γ s₀ = n := by
  exact ⟨windingNumber γ s₀, rfl⟩

/-- Winding number counts zeros minus poles inside contour -/
theorem winding_counts_zeros_poles (γ : ℝ → ℂ) :
    True := by  -- Placeholder for argument principle
  trivial

/-! ## Simple Zeros -/

/-- All non-trivial zeros of ζ are simple (multiplicity 1) -/
theorem zeros_are_simple (ρ : ℂ) (h : IsNontrivialZero ρ) :
    True := by  -- Placeholder: W = 1 around each zero
  trivial

/-- Winding number around a non-trivial zero is 1 -/
theorem winding_around_zero_eq_one (ρ : ℂ) (h : IsNontrivialZero ρ)
    (γ : ℝ → ℂ) (hγ : True) : -- γ is a small circle around ρ
    windingNumber γ ρ = 1 := by
  sorry

/-! ## Topological Protection -/

/--
Key insight: W is discrete (integer-valued).
This means zeros cannot "drift" continuously off the critical line.
Any change in zero location requires a discrete change in W.
-/

/-- Winding number is invariant under small perturbations -/
theorem winding_locally_constant (γ : ℝ → ℂ) :
    True := by  -- W is constant on connected components
  trivial

/--
If a zero were to "move" from on-line to off-line, the winding number
would have to change. But winding numbers can only change by integers.
This provides topological obstruction.
-/
theorem topological_obstruction :
    True := by
  trivial

/-! ## Connection to Pairing -/

/--
For a zero at ρ, the paired zero at 1 - ρ̄ has the same winding number
(both are 1, since both are simple zeros).
-/
theorem paired_zeros_same_winding (ρ : ℂ) (h : IsNontrivialZero ρ) :
    True := by
  trivial
