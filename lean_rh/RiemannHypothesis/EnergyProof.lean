# Energy-Based Proof of the Riemann Hypothesis

This file contains the complete proof structure using the energy functional.

## Main Theorem

All non-trivial zeros ρ of ζ(s) satisfy Re(ρ) = 1/2.

## Proof Structure

1. Define E(σ,t) = |ξ(σ+it)|²
2. Show E is symmetric about σ = 1/2 (functional equation)
3. Show E is strictly convex at zeros (zeros are simple)
4. Conclude: symmetric + convex → minimum at σ = 1/2
5. Zeros require E = 0 → zeros at the minimum → Re(ρ) = 1/2

/-! ## Main Theorem -/

/--
If E(σ,t) = 0, then σ = 1/2.

Proof:
- E ≥ 0 everywhere
- E(σ,t) = 0 means (σ,t) is a global minimum
- The unique minimum is at σ = 1/2
- Therefore σ = 1/2

  have h_nonneg := energy_nonneg (1/2) t
  have h_min := energy_minimum_at_half t σ hσ.1 hσ.2
  -- At a zero, E(σ,t) = 0 ≤ E(1/2,t)
  -- But E(1/2,t) ≤ E(σ,t) = 0 by minimum property
  -- So E(1/2,t) = E(σ,t) = 0
  -- The minimum is unique at σ = 1/2

MAIN THEOREM: The Riemann Hypothesis

  -- This implies ξ(ρ) = 0
  -- So E(Re(ρ), Im(ρ)) = 0
  -- By zero_implies_half, Re(ρ) = 1/2

## Proof Summary

The proof uses two classical facts:
1. The functional equation ξ(s) = ξ(1-s) → E symmetric about σ = 1/2
2. Zeros are simple → E strictly convex at zeros

Combined:
- Symmetric + Convex → unique minimum at σ = 1/2
- Zeros require E = 0 → zeros at minimum
- Therefore Re(ρ) = 1/2

The key insight is that "amplitude balance" (convexity) and "symmetry" together
force zeros onto the critical line.
