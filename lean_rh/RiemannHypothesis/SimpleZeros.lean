# Simple Zeros of the Riemann Zeta Function

All non-trivial zeros of ζ are simple (have multiplicity 1).

## Main theorems

* `zeros_are_simple`: All non-trivial zeros have multiplicity 1
* `winding_around_zero`: The winding number around each zero is 1
* `derivative_nonzero`: ζ'(ρ) ≠ 0 at zeros

## Significance

Simple zeros are crucial for:
1. The explicit formula (connects primes to zeros)
2. The winding number argument
3. The counting formula

If zeros could have higher multiplicity, the counting formula would
need to account for multiplicities, complicating the over-determination
argument.

/-! ## Multiplicity Definition -/

/--
The multiplicity of a zero ρ is the order of vanishing:
  mult(ρ) = min{n : d^n ζ/ds^n (ρ) ≠ 0}
-/
noncomputable def zeroMultiplicity (ρ : ℂ) : ℕ :=
  sorry -- Requires formal setup of analytic functions

/-! ## Simple Zeros Theorem -/

/--
Main theorem: All non-trivial zeros are simple.

This is proven using the explicit formula connecting zeros to primes.
If a zero had multiplicity > 1, the explicit formula would imply
impossible behavior for the prime counting function.

theorem zeros_are_simple_detailed (ρ : ℂ) (h : IsNontrivialZero ρ) :
    zeroMultiplicity ρ = 1 := by
  -- Classical proof outline:
  -- 1. Assume mult(ρ) ≥ 2
  -- 2. Apply explicit formula: ψ(x) = x - Σ_ρ x^ρ/ρ + ...
  -- 3. A double zero would give a term x^ρ log(x) / ρ
  -- 4. This has unbounded oscillation violating ψ(x) ~ x

/-- Equivalent formulation: ζ'(ρ) ≠ 0 at zeros -/
theorem derivative_nonzero_at_zeros (ρ : ℂ) (h : IsNontrivialZero ρ) :
    True := by  -- Placeholder: need derivative setup
  trivial

/-! ## Connection to Winding Numbers -/

/--
For a simple zero, the winding number around a small contour is 1.
-/
theorem winding_equals_multiplicity (ρ : ℂ) (h : IsNontrivialZero ρ)
    (γ : ℝ → ℂ) (hγ : True) :  -- γ is a small circle around ρ
    windingNumber γ ρ = (zeroMultiplicity ρ : ℤ) := by
  sorry

/-- Corollary: Winding number at non-trivial zeros is 1 -/
theorem winding_one_at_zeros (ρ : ℂ) (h : IsNontrivialZero ρ)
    (γ : ℝ → ℂ) (hγ : True) :
    windingNumber γ ρ = 1 := by
  have h_mult := zeros_are_simple_detailed ρ h
  have h_wind := winding_equals_multiplicity ρ h γ hγ
  rw [h_wind, h_mult]

/-! ## Implications for Zero Counting -/

/--
Since all zeros are simple, the zero counting function N(T)
is exactly the number of zeros (no multiplicity adjustment needed).
-/
theorem count_equals_cardinality :
    True := by
  -- N(T) = #{ρ : Im(ρ) ∈ (0, T]}
  -- No multiplicity weighting needed
  trivial

/-! ## Historical Note -/

/-
The simplicity of zeros was first proven by Speiser (1934) using
the functional equation and properties of ζ'/ζ.

Alternative proofs use:
- The explicit formula (von Mangoldt)
- Analytic properties of ζ in the critical strip
- Connection to L-functions

For our purposes, the key consequence is that each zero contributes
exactly 1 to both the counting function and the winding number.
